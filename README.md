# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am a Machine Learning Engineer with experiences and a broad interest in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Large Language Models(LLMs), Robotics, Data Analysis and Image Processing.

You may find my profile a bit empty, mostly because at least two of the big projects(50k+ lines of code) I've developed with are confidential and I was not updating with Git. But I'm an active developer and looking forward to bring up more updates here!
